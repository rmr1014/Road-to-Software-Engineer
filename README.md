# Road-to-Software-Engineer

This repository contains solutions and exercises from the Udacity CS101 course, organized by lesson. Each lesson contains Python scripts that solve specific programming problems.

## Structure

- `Udacity_CS101/Lesson_07/`
  - `RangeOfASet.py`: Calculates the range (max - min) of three input values using custom helper functions.
  - `Stamps.py`: Determines the minimum number of 5p, 2p, and 1p stamps needed to make up a given value in pence.
- `Udacity_CS101/Lesson_08/`
  - `DaysOld.py`: Contains helper functions for date calculations, including leap years and days between years. (Some functions are not fully implemented.)
  - `SuperheroNuisance.py`: Implements a function to check if a product string can be constructed from the characters in a debris string.
  - `test_DaysOld.py`: Basic tests for the `DaysOld.py` helper functions.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently with Python 3. Example:

```powershell
python Udacity_CS101/Lesson_07/RangeOfASet.py
```

## Notes
- These scripts are for educational purposes and follow the structure of the Udacity CS101 course.
- Some scripts may contain incomplete or partially implemented functions, as they are based on course exercises.
